# Summary
In project 3 I built an item-tracking program for the Corner Grocer, incorporating all of their requested functionality. They were interested in rearranging their produce section and needed to know how often items are purchased so they could create the most effective layout for their customers. The program CornerGrocerAnalyzer.cpp analyzes the text records (a list of items purchased in chronological order) generated throughout the day e.g., CornerGrocerInputs.txt. The program offers 4 menu options: (1) prompt a user to input the item or word, they wish to look for and return a numeric value for the frequency of the specific word, (2) Print the list with numbers that represent the frequency of all items purchased, (3) Print the same frequency information for all the items in the form of a histogram, and (4) exit the program.
